This algorithm is highly dependent on the previous behaviour of all users, with each user's actions playing a crucial role in determining the recommendations they are given. The primary differentiation between content-based filtering and collaborative filtering lies in the fact that in the latter, the algorithm used to generate suggestions is influenced by user interactions with the items.
